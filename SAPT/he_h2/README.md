# He----H2 example

Excercise:
----------
1. Run FCI  using Quantum Package for monomers A and B:
   - ground_state (R=6.6 bohr).
   - excited_state : He-H2* (H2* = 1\Sigma_u^+, R=4.0 bohr).

2. Run SAPT using GammCor.

You will find necessary xyz files in the `ground_state` and `excited_state` directories in the `he_h2` folder.

See the attached exercises.pdf file for details.
